## Project Overview

A full-featured, GTK3-based graphical Arch Linux installer built from scratch in Python.
No Calamares. No archinstall. Completely original.

**GitLab repo:** https://gitlab.com/broncbash/arch-installer (private until public release)
**Local repo:**   ~/arch-installer

### Design Philosophy
- Follows Arch Wiki installation standards exactly
- Experience-level system: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
  - Beginner: safe defaults, plain-English explanations, fewer choices
  - Intermediate: more options exposed, brief technical context
  - Advanced: full control, all options, technical detail
- Every screen has an info/hint panel that adapts to the selected experience level
- GTK3 + Python (same stack as the systemd-manager project)
- Dark GitHub-style theme (matching systemd-manager aesthetic)
- polkit / pkexec for privilege escalation where needed

## Installer Stage Map

Each stage is a separate GTK screen. Completed stages are marked ✅.

### State Object (installer/state.py)
All user selections flow through a single `InstallState` dataclass.
No screen writes to disk until Stage 14 (Review & Confirm) is accepted.
This makes it safe to go back and change options at any point.

### Key Design Rules
1. **Nothing is written to disk until the user confirms on the Review screen.**
2. Every backend function is wrapped to return `(success: bool, message: str)`.
3. All long operations run in background threads; GTK updates via `GLib.idle_add`.
4. Logging goes to `/tmp/arch-installer.log` during install.
5. The info panel on every screen pulls from a dict keyed by `(stage, experience_level)`.

## Stage 0 — Implementation Notes (welcome.py)

- `WelcomeScreen` extends `Gtk.Box` (horizontal split: left content + right info panel)
- Three `Gtk.EventBox` cards for Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
- Card state (hover, selected) driven entirely by CSS classes — no inline styling
- Info panel text lives in `WELCOME_INFO` dict keyed by experience level string
- `on_next` callback writes `state.experience_level` before handing off to the stage controller
- `main.py` uses a `Gtk.Stack` with `SLIDE_LEFT` transitions (220ms); new stages are registered in the `STAGE_CLASSES` list

## Current Session Notes

**Session 1 — Project bootstrap**
- Decided on full architecture (see above)
- Created repo skeleton, all placeholder files
- Created CLAUDE.md, README.md, LICENSE, PKGBUILD, .gitignore
- Created installer/main.py (entry point + window scaffold)
- Created installer/state.py (InstallState dataclass)
- Created installer/ui/base_screen.py (base class with info panel)
- Created assets (SVG + PNG icon)

**Session 2 — Stage 0: Welcome / Experience Level**
- Implemented `installer/ui/welcome.py` (WelcomeScreen)
- Implemented `installer/assets/style.css` (dark GitHub theme, full palette)
- Updated `installer/main.py` with Gtk.Stack stage controller and Stage 0 wired in
- Next session: **Stage 1 — Keyboard Layout** (`installer/ui/keyboard.py`)

**What to tell Claude next session:**
> "We're building an Arch Linux GTK3 installer in Python. Here's the full context: [paste this file].
>  Today I want to work on Stage 1 — Keyboard Layout."

## Known Issues / Deferred Decisions

- [ ] Btrfs subvolume layout presets (defer until filesystem screen)
- [ ] LVM support (intermediate/advanced only — defer)
- [ ] Dual-boot / existing partition detection (defer until partition screen)
- [ ] Wireless network setup UI (defer until network screen)
- [ ] Whether to bundle a default mirrorlist or always fetch live (decide at mirror screen)
